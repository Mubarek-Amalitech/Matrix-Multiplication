# Matrix-Multiplication
## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to gain an understanding of several core programming concepts, including:

- **Variables, Loops, and Conditional Statements**: Developing proficiency in essential programming constructs.
- **2D Arrays**: Gaining experience in creating and manipulating two-dimensional arrays.
- **User Input Handling and Data Casting**: Learning how to control user input and cast data between different types.
- **String Formatting**: Mastering string formatting techniques to display output in a readable and organized format.
- **Problem Analysis and Algorithm Development**: Improving the ability to analyze problem requirements and develop efficient algorithms to solve mathematical problems.

### Task Description

The program will perform the multiplication of two matrices, `A` and `B`, that are provided by the user. The result of the matrix multiplication will be stored in a third matrix, `C`, which will then be displayed to the user.
